= HALP

Just saw this repo in need of help and I actually wanted to see it run.  Plus I have an unhealthy fascination with writing code that I can see work.

In addition to the reasons above I am also selfishly interested in the idea of using Raphael.js as a way of visualizing the games that I want to use for my ai server project (hqmq/ai-server)

So onwards and downwards with some visualization code.

Did I mention that I totally suck at coffeescript?
